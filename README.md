## What did we Use
### Frontend
For the frontend we used 
- Java script
- HTML
- CSS

The frontend was made with Javascript we have not writen mucht in to the HTML we all made it with JAVA script and DOM because we need to add value we need to make a conection to our JSON file and on how many Value with have it makes so many divs.
### Backend
For the backend we used 
- Node.js 
- JSON

The backend was made with Node.js and we made a JSON server with it instead of a normal DB we made a self made DB with JSON beacause it was not worth it making a db for only saving Text so we made it with JSON the chalanging part is making a DB out of a JSON because you have to take the value from the json and then add it and write it back so it is technicaly allways a new writen file
